Bug 1:
Ran SetTester.java
emptySet_testIsEmpty fails
Set breakpoint at line 112 where emptySet_testIsEmpty is ran
Stepped into the ArraySet constructor where there was no problems
Stepped into testIsempty and into ArraySet isEmpty()
Found return on line 44 which has rear > 0 which would not be true with an Empty ArraySet
Then created an if-else statement where if rear == 0 return true, anything else false
Reran tester - emptySet_testIsEmpty now is valid and passes

Bug 2:
Ran SetTester.java from handout files
emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty fails
Set breakpoint on line 147 where emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty is being Ran
Stepped into the array set constructor where there was no problems
Stepped into line 134 of SetTester to get element T method
Found that setArray is containing the value for Int A but the rear did not equal Int ArraySet
On line 63 I put rear++ at the end of the code to set the rear equal to the number of eleemnts in the ArraySet
Reran tester - emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty now passes

Bug 3:
Ran SetTester.java from handout files
testRemove fails with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
I set the breakpoint on line 262 because the terminal told me the test A_addB_AB_testRemoveA was failing
I then stepped through adding elements to the ArraySet where there was no problems 
Then I stepped through to line 591 of the Set Tester to which I then stepped to line 71 of the ArraySet which is the method to remove a number in the ArraySet
On line 78 I added the expandCapacity method because it doubles the size of the array and there will no longer be ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Reran tester - testRemove Passes
